Here you will find the complete, very old, and maybe buggy at this point, source code for Touhou Border Enforcer. The fact that it was made in the last already years old GameMaker version for Linux doesn't help. But all the code and assets should be there, this is all I was able to save before BitBucket stopped being free. From what I gathered, it's at least 90% of the project, if something is missing, it is some minor assets only, but maybe all is there, I haven't checked (yet).
If you happen to use this code/fork this project, first I recommend you to optimize the timers code (even if it has some minor optimizations, it should be done properly from the start) second, I will assume the project can be opened by both modern Windows' GameMaker and last GameMaker Linux version, and lastly, I would appreciate if you mention my github somewhere.
